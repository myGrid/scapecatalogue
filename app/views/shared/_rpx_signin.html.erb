		<h4>General</h4>
		
		<p>
			Instead of signing up for (or signing in with) a <%= SITE_NAME -%> specific account,
			you can use an existing "single sign-on" account that you may have from
			a number of popular providers. You will be redirected to an external service (RPX)
			which will handle the login to your external account. After that a new account on 
			<%= SITE_NAME -%> will automatically be created (if required) and you will be signed in.
			Note that we DO NOT store any password information from your external accounts.
		</p>
		
		<h4>OpenID</h4>
		
		<p>
			OpenID is a distributed identity system which gives you single sign-on 
			anywhere that OpenID is supported. If you already have an OpenID account
			you can sign in using the link above and your <%= SITE_NAME -%> account will automatically be created
			(note that many other accounts, like AOL, AIM, LiveJournal, Wordpress, may already be OpenID enabled so you can use that too).
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Don't have an OpenID? Get one from <%= link_to 'myOpenID', "https://www.myopenid.com/" %> or 
			<%= link_to 'other providers', "http://openiddirectory.com/openid-providers-c-1.html" %>.
