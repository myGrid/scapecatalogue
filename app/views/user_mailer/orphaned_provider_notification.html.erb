Dear <%= SITE_NAME -%> Member,
<p />

We have noticed that the Service Provider '<%=h @provider.name -%>' no longer has any services and/or hostnames associated with it.  
<br />

<%= link_to "View Service Provider (#{@provider.name}) in #{SITE_NAME}",
            :only_path => false,
            :host => @base_url,
            :controller => 'service_providers',
            :action => 'show',
            :id => @provider.id -%>

<p />
