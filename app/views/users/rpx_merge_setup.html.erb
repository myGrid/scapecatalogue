					Are you sure you want to merge the following accounts:
					<br/><br/>
					<b>New account</b> that has the external account identifier of: <br/><%= h @rpx_data[:identifier] -%>
					<br/><br/>
					into
					<br/><br/>
					<b>Existing <%= SITE_NAME -%> account</b> that has the email address: <br/><%= h current_user.email -%>
				</p>
				
				<p class="box_info_standout" style="font-size: 93%;">
					Note: only the info about the external account identifier will be merged into the existing account. 
					After merging you will have one single account and member profile, but you'll be able to sign in 
					using either the external account (<%= list_of_rpx_accounts -%>) or the <b>original email address and password</b> you signed up with.
					If you don't merge then you will have two accounts and member profiles in <%= SITE_NAME -%>.
