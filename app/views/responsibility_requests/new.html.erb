	<h5> Requesting Responsibility for Service:  <%=link_to @service.name, service_url(@service) %></h5>
</p>

<h6> What does requesting responsibility for a service mean? </h6>
<p class="box_info_standout">	
	Some services in <%= SITE_NAME -%> have been registered by people who do not normally maintain the service or
	are responsible for the service in any way. This responsibility request mechanism allows people that maintain or own
	the service to be given the permissions to manage the entry in <%= SITE_NAME -%>
</p>

<h6> What happens when you submit a request? </h6>
<p class="box_info_standout">
	The people currently responsible for the service will be informed about your request.
	You will also receive a confirmation mail for the request once it is successfully submitted.
	You will also be informed by mail when the request is approved or turned down.
