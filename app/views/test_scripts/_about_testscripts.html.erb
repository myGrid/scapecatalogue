		<b>About Test Scripts</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		Test scripts are simple clients to web services which can be uploaded to <%= SITE_NAME -%>.
		The aims of the test scripts are to provide the users with sample clients of how to use the service
		and also to enable the <%= SITE_NAME -%> system to monitor the status of the services by running these sample clients regularly. <br />
		
		Allowed test scripts are those written in python, perl or ruby. Also <%= link_to 'soapUI', 'http://www.soapui.org/'-%>  test suites
		(xml project files) can be submitted.		
	</p>
